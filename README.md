Next-Split-Template

This is an opinionated Next.js template bootstrapped with create-next-app.

This tries to maintain a separation between API and Client side UI, which is not the intended use of NextJS 14.

Getting Started

Have docker (or podman + docker support) installed.
Have NodeJS 20 or higher even number installed. (You can use Volta or NVM to manage multiple NodeJS versions.)
Create a copy of the file .env.example, rename it to .env and change values if needed.
Run docker compose up in project root directory (or alternative) to start a postgresql server.
Have pnpm installed (this is faster than npm): npm i -g pnpm.
Run pnpm install to install dependencies.
Run pnpm dev to start the development server.
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

Running database migrations

Use pnpm drizzle-kit studio to view database content in browser. Or use a tool like HeidiSQL or DBeaver.
When you are in development mode and trying out things locally, use pnpm drizzle-kit push:pg to update the db according to your schemas at any time. Never use this in production.
Before committing, run pnpm drizzle-kit generate:pg to generate migration scripts.
Run pnpm tsx migrate-db.ts in production/staging to run database migrations.

Conventions

Write TypeScript.
Use app/api for (json) API routes.
Keep core logic/views inside modules folder organized by feature. Core logic shouldn't depend on NextJS-specific APIs. Use your best judgement.
Keep database schemas in relevant feature modules and make sure to name them schema.ts.
Keep common code that glue NextJS to other parts of the app inside lib.
Keep reusable React components inside components.
IconButton üëç Do
DashboardView üëé Don't
Keep pages for each route in the corresponding folder.
e.g., Page to show orders by a user
example url: users/123/orders
route handler: app/users/[id]/orders/page.tsx
Change the theme in tailwind.config.ts according to your design system and use them consistently and try to avoid arbitrary values

## Getting Started

1. Have docker (or podman + docker support) installed.
2. Have NodeJS 20 or higher _even number_ installed. (You can use
   [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage
   multiple NodeJS versions.)
3. Create a copy of the file `.env.example`, rename it to `.env` and change
   values if needed.
4. Run `docker compose up` in project root directory (or alternative) to start a
   postgresql server.
5. Have pnpm installed (this is faster than npm): `npm i -g pnpm`.
6. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
7. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server.
