# NextJS split template

This is an opinionated [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) template bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This tries to maintain a separation between API and Client side UI, which is not
the intended use of NextJS 14.

## Stack

      - [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) + [React](https://react.dev/)
      - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
      - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
      - [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)

### Other libraries used

## Getting Started

      1. Have docker (or podman + docker support) installed.
      2. Have NodeJS 20 or higher _even number_ installed. (You can use
         [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage
         multiple NodeJS versions.)
      3. Create a copy of the file `.env.example`, rename it to `.env` and change
         values if needed.
      4. Run `docker compose up` in project root directory (or alternative) to start a
         postgresql server.
      5. Have pnpm installed (this is faster than npm): `npm i -g pnpm`.
      6. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
      7. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server.
      8. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see
         the result.

### Running database migrations

      1. Use `pnpm drizzle-kit studio` to view database content in browser. Or use
         a tool like HeidiSQL or DBeaver.
      2. When you are in development mode and trying out things locally, use
         `pnpm drizzle-kit push:pg` to update the db according to your schemas at any
         time. Never use this in production.
      3. Before committing, run `pnpm drizzle-kit generate:pg` to generate migration
         scripts.
      4. Run `pnpm tsx migrate-db.ts` in production/staging to run database
         migrations.

## Conventions

      - Write TypeScript.
      - Use `app/api` for (json) API routes.
      - Keep core logic/views inside `modules` folder organized by feature. Core logic
     **shouldn't depend on NextJS-specific APIs**. Use your best judgement.
      - Keep database schemas in relevant feature `modules` and make sure to name them
        `schema.ts`.
      - Keep common code that glue NextJS to other parts of the app inside `lib`.
      - Keep reusable React components inside `components`.  
           - `IconButton` 👍 Do
           - `DashboardView` 👎 Don't
      - Keep pages for each route in the corresponding folder.  
              e.g., Page to show orders by a user  
           example url: `users/123/orders`  
        route handler: `app/users/[id]/orders/page.tsx`
      - [Change the theme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#customizing-your-theme)
        in `tailwind.config.ts` according to your design system and use them
        consistently and try to avoid
        [arbitrary values](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-arbitrary-values)
